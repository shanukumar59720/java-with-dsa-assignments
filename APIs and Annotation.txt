import java.time.*;

public class rough {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        System.out.println(date);

        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        System.out.println(time);
    }
}

2. Write a program to convert a date a string in the format “MM/DD/YYYY”
import java.time.*;

public class rough {

        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        int day = date.getDayOfMonth();
        int month = date.getMonthValue();
        int year = date.getYear();

        System.out.println(month + "/" + day + "/" + year);
    }
}

3. What is the difference between collections and streams? Explain with an example.
Collections: Collection is a set of interfaces and classes which can be used to store, delete, retrieve, and manipulate the data or information which is in large number.

Streams: streams are used to process a group of objects from the collection. Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods. Once worked on a stream then it can’t do another work, which means one task to one stream.
