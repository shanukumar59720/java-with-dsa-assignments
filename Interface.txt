Assignment Solutions

1. What is an interface in java?
An interface is a reference type, similar to a class that contains only abstract methods. An interface cannot be instantiated. It can only be implemented by a classes.
When a class implements an interface, it must provide implementations for all of the interface’s methods.

2. Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an interface? Explain with an example.
Public modifiers are allowed for methods in an interface. And along with it an abstract modifier also.

3. What is the use of interface in Java? Or, why do we use an interface in java?
Interface is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the quality of your Java code. And it can help you to achieve abstraction, multiple inheritance, loose coupling, and polymorphism and dependency injection.

4. What is the difference between abstract class and interface in java?
Abstract class-
Every method present inside abstract class need not be public and abstract.
There are no restrictions on abstract class method modifiers.
Every abstract class variable need not be public, static and final.
Inside the abstract class we can take constructor.

Interface-
Every method present inside the interface is always public and abstract whether we’re declaring or not.
We can’t declare interface methods with the modifiers private, protected, final, static, synchronized, native, strictfp.
Every interface variable is always a public static final whether we are declaring or not following modifiers, private, protected, transient, and volatile.
Inside the interface we can’t take constructor.
